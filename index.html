    <h3> Masters Thesis </h3>
    <h4> Title: "Design and Development of Thin Film Sensors" </h4>
    <p>
      Thin film sensor's ( thermocouple and strain gauge ) deposition was carried out by using DC & RF magnetron sputtering and the parameters
      for deposition were optimized on Kaptan tape. Insulation and Insulation and  bond coat were studied for INCONEL (gas turbine blade material)
      and the deposition parameters for these on INCONEL were optimized. Characterization was done by	SEM and  X-Ray diffraction techniques to
      ensure proper layers of bond and insulation coats.Strain gauge and thermocouple are then deposited on the insulation coat and the parameters
      were optimized.
    </p>

    <h4>Other Responsibilities in the lab</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Determining and analyzing the microstructures of the deposited coats by using SEM and X-ray diffraction techniques.</li>
      <li>Creating the monthly status reports and sending it to the customers.	</li>
      <li>Managing and maintaining the required materials.</li>
      <li>Maintaining 5S system in the laboratory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Additional Projects </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked on thin film kesterite based solar cells by using magnetron sputtering and thermal evaporation system.</li>
      <li>Worked on solid oxide fuel cells made by screen printing and learned about sol-gel techniques.</li>
      <li>Worked on hydroxyappatite coating on condyle using plasma spray method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Bachelors Thesis</h3>
    <h4> Title:  Estimation of Structural Parameters of Ge-C alloys using cluster variation method </h4>
    <p>
      Experimental determination of phase diagrams is a time consuming and costly task. This becomes even more pronounced as
      the number of components increases. Cluster variation method has been employed in this project to determine the free
      energies of a 2D binary alloy system (Ge-C). Using these determined free energies, the phase diagram has been plotted using Mathematica.
      This calculated phase diagram has been compared with the phase diagram obtained using ThermoCalc software.
